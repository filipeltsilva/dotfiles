# My dotfiles

This is my dotfiles repository, that includes my configuration files and the necessary scripts to install and setup them. For now it was run and tested only in a macOS systems, but in the future I pretend to port it to work in Linux systems too.

## How to setup in macOS systems

In macOS systems, first is necessary install the Xcode or then the Xcode Command Line Tools as a smaller alternative through the command below:

```shell
xcode-select --install
```

After install Xcode, copy and paste [this command](https://gist.github.com/filipeltsilva/39192759622a1ae1cd6381636e76ad8f) in a terminal to install Homebrew and Git.

Then, clone this repository to the ~/.dotfiles folder, access the folder and run the install.sh file.
